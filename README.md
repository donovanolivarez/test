# test

this is a test repo.

This is an edit to the current branch.

This is another edit to the NewBranch.

Someone edits here that is not me.

My New Edit that doesn't conflict.

Someone else just edited the master.

Here is my LAST EDIT.

This is what I will submit, and there should be a merge conflict.
